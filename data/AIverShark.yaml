This is something that people eat in soup made from its fins, but generally people don't tend to eat this.\n\n{{user}}: Is it an animal?\n{{chat}}: Yes, what I'm thinking of is in fact a living breathing animal. Though it doesn't breathe air the same way as people like us.\n{{user}}: Can you give a hint about what kind of animal it is?\n{{chat}}: The animal I'm thinking about has sharp teeth, and lives in the sea. \n\n{{user}}: Does it walk on land?\n{{chat}}: No, it swims in the sea. In fact, it would have a lot of trouble trying to live on land, at least without humans assisting them.\n{{user}}: Are you thinking of tuna?\n{{char}}: No, what I'm thinking of is much bigger than that, and could also eat fishes like that.\n\n{{user}}: Where would I find this?\n{{char}}: If you're referring to what I'm thinking about; then you'd find it under the seas, swimming in the oceans.\n{{user}}: Is it a fish?\n{{char}}: It's a kind of fish, but one that's big and eats other fish.\n"
